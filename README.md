## Project Description
This product automates window shades with the goal of saving energy consumption in homes. We have chosen this ISP because it is both real-world applicable and easy to implement. Many homeowners would want to save money on their electricity bill, and environmental organizations would want to reduce the consumption of energy, especially through non-renewable sources. The automation of window shades could help with the regulation of temperature in homes, as sunlight can warm up homes through windows. This will be relatively easy to implement, as the main computer is a Raspberry Pi connected to a motor which controlls existing window shades. The computer will use sensors for sunlight and indoor temperature, as well as APIs for weather in order to determine the optimal amount of sunlight coming through the window shades.
